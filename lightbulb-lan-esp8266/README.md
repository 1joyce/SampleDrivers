# SmartThings Edge - ESP8266 LAN LightBulb

### Motivation

In an attempt to address one of the most concurrent insights at our Community _(local
control of our devices)_, I decided that it would be a great idea to get hands-on with
a project to integrate an ESP8266 board into the _SmartThings ecosystem_ via _LAN_, and what better _“Hello world”_
example than a _Switch-based_ device integration.
