# SmartThings Edge Drivers

## What is SmartThings Edge?
SmartThings Edge is our new architecture that takes smart home events that would have happened on the SmartThings Cloud and moves them to your SmartThings Hub.
Edge Drivers are [Lua©-based](https://www.lua.org/) and can be used for Zigbee, Z-Wave, and LAN devices.
SmartThings Edge also brings new benefits such as reduced latency and cloud costs.

## Getting Started
In this repository, you’ll find different ready-to-install samples that can help you integrate your devices to the SmartThings platform and also create a driver of your own.

Make sure you comply with the prerequisites and follow the Driver installation and Device onboarding instructions in the Community post of each sample.

For more information regarding Edge Drivers, look at the resources in “More Information”
