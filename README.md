# SmartThings Edge Drivers

## What is SmartThings Edge?
SmartThings Edge is our new architecture for Hub Connected devices that uses Device Drivers to execute commands locally on SmartThings Hubs. Edge Drivers are [Lua©-based](https://www.lua.org/) and can be used for Hub Connected devices, including Zigbee, Z-Wave, and LAN protocols. SmartThings Edge will brings new benefits such as reduced latency and cloud costs.


## Getting Started
In this repository, you’ll find different ready-to-install sample Edge Drivers that can help you integrate your devices to the SmartThings platform.

Make sure you comply with the prerequisites and follow the Driver installation and Device onboarding instructions in the Community post of each sample.

For more information on building Edge Drivers, look at the resources in [More Information](#More-Information)
